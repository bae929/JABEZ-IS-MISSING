            <p>Jabez likes to multitask. But, he is not very good at it.</p>
            <p>Good luck trying to grab his attention if he is talking to someone, watching drama, or eating food!</p>
            <img src= "jabby.jpg" width="50%">
            <p>Just kidding! He is just very attentive and focused on one thing at a time, which makes for a pretty interesting and cool character trait.</p>
        </div>
        <p style="color:red">UPDATE: He was just washing dishes everyone -- such a good son.</p>
