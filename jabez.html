            <p>Jabez likes to multitask. But, he is not very good at it.</p>
            <p>Good luck trying to grab his attention if he is talking to someone, watching drama, or eating food!</p>

            <p>Just kidding! He is just very attentive and focused on one thing at a time, which makes for a pretty interesting and cool character trait.</p>
